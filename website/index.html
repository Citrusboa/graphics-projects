		<!-- Expectations -->
		<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Expectations</h3></div><div class="panel-body">
			<dt><b>Lectures are not everything</b></dt>
			<dd>
				The lectures are designed to give you a solid understanding of the basic concepts of computer graphics, but they do not cover everything you need to know to complete the assignments. For example, I will not be talking about the specifics of APIs, libraries, or coding environments, so you will need to find them out by yourself. Such specifics will become obsolete in several years, so we focus more on fundamental ideas that will be relevant for many more years. The instructor designed the assignments such that you do not need to deal with those as much as possible. We cannot cover all the technical details in the lectures in order to convey the most important fundamental ideas in a limited time. If you want to understand in more detail, we recommend asking questions or referring to the additional resources.
			</dd>
			
			
			<dt><b>Requirements</b></dt>
			<dd>
				While there is no hard requirement (besides the prerequisite courses as specified), generally speaking, we except students to be comfortable with probability, linear algebra, and calculus. Since this course involves quite a bit of coding tasks, you are also expected to be somewhat comfortable with algorithms and data structures, coding environment, debugging, and trouble-shooting in programming (especially in C++). You will need to have access to a coding environment (e.g., Visual Studio). 
			</dd>
			
			
			<dt><b>Marking scheme</b></dt>
			<dd>
				Students are evaluated based only on the coding assignments. Your score relies on the successful completion of the programming tasks as described in each assignment. Each assignment contributes toward the final score as
				<ul>
					<li>A0: 0%</li>
					<li>A1: 20%</li>
					<li>A2: 20%</li>
					<li>A3: 20%</li>
					<li>Project proposal: 10%</li>
					<li>Project: 30%</li>
				</ul>
				We have no midterm and final exams. Students should contact the TAs about concerns about the marking of submitted work within a week of the date it was first returned to the students. If the issues cannot be resolved between the TA and the student, the TA will inform the instructor, who will make the final decision. Note that graduate students in 688 will have additional tasks in the final project and will generally be assessed more strictly than undergraduate students. The instructor reserves the right to adjust the grades after the score is calculated above, but typically there will be no adjustment. Due to the varying nature of assignments between terms in this course, there will usually be no INC grade.
			</dd>
			
			
			<dt><b>Group work</b></dt>
			<dd>
				Group work is NOT allowed in this course. Your code should be written entirely by yourself. We will be able to detect if you copied code from other students. However, discussions among students are highly encouraged. A rule of thumb is that you should fully understand what you are doing and submit the code you wrote only by yourself. 
			</dd>
			
			<dt><b>Use of other resources</b></dt>
			<dd>
				You may not copy code from previous offers of this or a similar course, solutions by other students, or other resources. If you are in doubt, please consult the instructor first before you write your code. The same rule applies to machine-learning assisted coding tools (e.g., ChatGPT), though our experience is that it usually does not work well for complicated tasks or quite misleading in some cases, at least as of May 2023.
			</dd>
			
			
			<dt><b>Late submissions</b></dt>
			<dd>
				Each student is allotted a total of FOUR late-day integer points. Use your late-day points to accommodate unexpected situations, such as your internet connection being down right before the deadline or forgetting or missing the deadline. No questions will be asked. Late-day points work as follows;
				<ul>
					<li>You can extend an assignment deadline by one day using one point. You can do this multiple times for one assignment, if needed, by using multiple points.</li>
					<li>If you have no remaining late-day points, late submissions will incur 10% penalty per day for up to three days.</li>
					<li>No submissions will be accepted more than three days after the deadline. This is true whether or not the student has late-day points remaining.</li>
				</ul>
				Assignments whose marking requires any corrective action from the course staff to address student's submission mistakes (e.g., missing files, files with incorrect names and/or permissions, problems with makefiles etc.) will be treated as three days late (i.e., 30% penalty). In some extreme cases, such as missing all the files (at the instructor's discretion), it will not be accepted and receive zero points. If you notice such a mistake after the deadline, you may use your late-day point to recover your mistake. Read the instructions carefully to avoid losing any points!
			</dd>
			
			
			<dt><b>Extensions, Solutions, and Absences</b></dt>
			<dd>
				We do not extend deadlines under normal circumstances based on students' requests. Do not even try to ask for it. The instructor may, however, decide to extend the deadlines at his or her discretion when it makes sense (again, not based on students' requests). Follow the formal procedure if the university's policy covers your situation. We will not provide source code solutions for assignments. It's your responsibility to make sure that your code runs correctly. You may not publish your code at any point during and after the course. The deadlines for assignments are posted below. If you have planned absences, start work early to avoid missing deadlines. We will not extend or move deadlines to accommodate such planned absences.

				<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b> In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/</a> for more information.]
				</p>

				<p><b>Grievance:</b> A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70"> Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a>, Section 4. When in doubt please be certain to contact the department's administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.
				</p>

				<p><b>Discipline:</b> A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity [check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/</a>] to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about 'rules' for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.
				</p>

				<p><b>Appeals:</b> A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 (Student Petitions and Grievances) (other than a petition) or Policy 71 (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat-general-counsel/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.
				</p>

				<p><b>Turnitin.com:</b> Text matching software (TurnitinÂ®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. TurnitinÂ® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course. </p>

				<p><b>Note for Students with Disabilities:</b> AccessAbility Services, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.
