    <h2>CS 488/688: Introduction to Computer Graphics</h2>
    <h4>Assignment 0: Warmup</h4>	<hr/>
	</center>

	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
	The goal of this assignment is to get you accustomed to things that we will use throughout the term. There will be a small amount of coding.
	</p>
	<p>
	This assignment is <em>optional</em>. If you do not hand it in, you will not lose marks. If you do hand it in, it will be marked in the normal way, but the mark will not count towards your final grade. The assignment is for you to help avoiding losing marks on future assignments for reasons that have nothing to do with understanding the material (such as misunderstanding the submission instructions, or failing to include appropriate documentation). Completing Assignment 0 will help you avoid making any such mistakes when it counts. You'll also get some direct experience with the kind of code you'll be writing throughout the term.
	</p>
	<p>
	Conversely, it's always possible that we've introduced our own errors in the code we're distributing to you this term. In particular, we have made significant changes to the base code as well as assignments in S23, so things might be rather unstable. Thus, it's helpful to us for you to complete Assignment 0: your feedback will help us iron out any problems before they derail future assignments.
	</p>
	<p>
	The directions in this assignment are more explicit than in the remaining assignments. In the other assignments, the steps to follow will not be given in so much detail.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Step 0: Course information</h3>
	<p>
	Get acquainted with the information associated with this course. Read the main course web page. Read the course web page and make sure your responsibilities are clear and that you are familiar with the marking scheme. Read the <a href="assignments-info.html">additional notes</a> regarding assignments before completing this assignment or submitting anything.
	</p>

	<h3>Step 1: Piazza</h3>
	<p>
	In order to ask questions, help your fellow students, and keep up with timely announcements, you will need to enroll in the Piazza page for this course. Take a look at the LEARN web page of CS488 to find out the link for registration. Please register as soon as possible.
	<p>

	<h3>Step 2: Framework</h3>
	<p>
	Many traditional courses in computer graphics use OpenGL for 3D graphics, where students have to go through specifics of OpenGL APIs (which are not very useful in practice, in our opinion). Some modern courses use a complete graphics framework such as Unity to focus only on high-level ideas (which hide too many fundamental concepts, in our opinion). For this course, we seek a middle ground: enough infrastructure to help you get started without hiding the technical details of fundamental concepts. Our framework is educationally designed, so you will get to touch the fundamentals of 3D graphics. You do not call OpenGL APIs - you implement those features by yourselves. We're using the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li><a href="https://glew.sourceforge.net/">GLEW</a>, a cross-platform open-source C/C++ extension loading library for OpenGL extensions (used just for drawing images - you do not need to use those extensions by yourself).</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a>, a simple framework that wraps an OpenGL context inside a window and manages user events (used for opening a window and providing simple UI - again, you do not need to deal with GFLW by yourself).</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/sgorsten/linalg">linalg</a>, a mathematical library for the parts of linear algebra needed in computer graphics. </li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb</a>, we use stb_image.h and stb_image_write.h for loading and writing image files.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/charlietangora/gif-h">gif.h</a>, for capturing an animated GIF.</li>
		<li>cs488.h, a single header framework for this course.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	It is expected that you keep developing on top of the initial <code>cs488.h</code> throughout the course. For example, once you completed the assignment 1, your <code>cs488.h</code> is now capable of rasterizing 3D objects, and you can use it as your starting point for the assignment 2 (e.g., using rasterization as an interactive rendering mode). The idea is that you have your own customized graphics engine at the end of A3 which is at least capable of rasterization, ray tracing, and simple physics-based animation. For consistency of grading, we do not allow you to build on top of another framework than <code>cs488.h</code>.
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
	If you find that you need to re-download the base code later in the term, be certain not to overwrite any of your older code! In such cases it may be worthwhile to backup your source files first, or to unzip the distribution into a separate folder and copy files over individually.
	</div>

	<p>To avoid potential problems with missing libraries or incorrect versions, we will use CMake for building the code. You will clone the repository that contains the source code for all these libraries, bundled with skeleton code for the assignments. The external libraries are incorporated as git submodules, so you will need to run the following commands to clone the repository:
	<pre>$ git clone --recursive https://git.uwaterloo.ca/w576wang/cs488</pre>
	Make sure to include <code>--recursive</code> such that all external libraries will be clone in <code>./external</code>. You shouldn't need to change anything in that directory. Currently, our CMake files specify that the code will be compiled with C++14. If you prefer to use c++17, then edit <code>./CMakeLists.txt</code> and change "set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)" to "set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)".
	</p>
	<p>Let's try to configure the build step by step. We encourage you to use solid IDEs like Visual Studio or Clion etc. If you prefer VS Code or something else, feel free to use. Now we will show how to set things up on Windows using Visual Studio or Mac using Clion (you can use your student account to get a free license) or Linux using VS Code. You may skip reading the rest of Step 3 if you know what to do give the code.
		</p>
		<h3>Step 3a: Build on Windows</h3>
		<p><b>If you are familiar with using CMake on Windows, you probably want to skip reading this step. </b> To use CMake on Windows, a good choice is to use CMake GUI and Visual Studio. Both of them can be downloaded and installed using x64 installer. After installation, you can open CMake GUI and set the source code directory to <code>.../cs488</code> and set the build directory to <code>.../cs488/build</code>. </p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3a_1.png"/>
		</center>
		<p>Then click "Configure" and choose "Visual Studio 17 2022" as the generator.</p> 
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3a_2.png"/>
		</center>
		<p>After that, you will see a list of options that you can set, but you don't need set anything for now. Just click "Generate" and you will get a Visual Studio solution file in <code>.../cs488/build</code> named <code> CS488.sln </code>.</p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3a_3.png"/>
		</center>
		<p>Now you can open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project. Don't forget to set CS488 as the starting project such that now you can click "Local Windows Debugger" on the top to build and run the solution.</p>
		 <center>
			<img style="max-width : 40%" src="a0_res/s3a_4.png"/>
		</center>
		<h3>Step 3b: Build on Mac</h3>
		<p><b>If you are familiar with Clion, you can skip reading this step. Before opening Clion, make sure you have installed CMake on your Mac(a easy way is to use Homebrew).</b> To use CMake on Mac, we will use Clion instead of XCode(more friendly to beginners). After installing Clion, open it. Click <code>Open</code> in the middle and then we can directly select the repository folder to create a Clion project. </p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3b_1.png"/>
		</center>
		<p>After creating the project, Clion will automatically configure it based on the CMakeLists.txt. You can check the progress from the CMake window at the bottom.</p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3b_2.png"/>
		</center>
		<p>Now you can click the green triangle on the top to build and run the project. But if you want to run with the release mode, it's missing here. What you need to do is that go to <code>CLion | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake</code>and click <code>+</code> to add a release build.  </p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3b_3.png"/>
		</center>
		<h3>Step 3c: Build on Linux</h3>
		<p><b>If you are familiar with CMake and GCC, you can skip reading this step. </b> Please make sure you install CMake (through your default system package manager (e.g. <code>apt-get</code> on Ubuntu) or by getting the pre-built binaries from <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">Download page</a>) and GCC (<code>sudo apt-get install build-essential</code> on Ubuntu). Create a new directory for the build, change to that directory, and run <code>cmake [path to CS488]</code>. A Makefile will be created in the current directory. Next, run <code>make</code> to build CS488. Depending on the number of cores in your system, you will probably want to supply make with the <code>-j</code> parameter to specify the number of compilation jobs to run in parallel (e.g. <code>make -j8</code>).</p>
		<p>In case that you prefer debugging your codes on IDEs, we provide a tutorial of configuring CS488 project on VS Code. <b>If you don't plan to use VS Code or you are familiar with VS Code, you can skip reading this step.</b></p> To complete the tutorial, please install the following:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></li>
			<li>C++ extension for VS Code. Install the C/C++ extension by searching for 'c++' in the <b>Extensions</b> view (<code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code>).</li>
			<li>CMake Tools extension for VS Code. Install the CMake Tools extension by searching for 'CMake tools' in the <b>Extensions</b> view (<code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code>).</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>
			Open up Visual Studio Code and select <i>File → Open Folder..</i> from the program menu. Next, browse to where we cloned the CS488 project. Basically, the directory that contains the CMakeLists.txt file, so <code>[path to CS488]</code>.
			You might see a dialog where VS Code asks you if you trust the author of the files in the folder. You can click the <i>Yes, I trust the authors</i> button on the dialog to get rid of it.
			After importing the CS488 into VS Code, move your gaze to the status bar at the bottom:
		</p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 100%" src="a0_res/s3c_statusbar.png"/>
		</center>
		<p>
			You can see two interesting things here:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CMake:[DEBUG]:Ready. This shows that VS Code indeed detected that our project is a CMake project. By default it will build a debug version of our application. Which is perfect during development and we can leave it at that. If you ever want to change the build type, you can simply click on this text in the status bar.</li>
			<li>No Kit Selected. A kit just means the C/C++ development tools we prefer to use. For example GCC or CLANG. You might have multiple development tools installed on your system. Therefore we need to inform VS Code’s CMake extension, which one to use.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>
			At this point, the only step left for us is to let VS Code know which kit we prefer to use in combination with CMake. To select the kit, click on the <i>No Kit Selected</i> text in the status bar. A selection box pops up at the top, where you can select C/C++ development tools that Visual Studio Code detected on your system. We installed GCC at an earlier step, so select that option:
		</p>
		<center>
			<img style="max-width : 50%" src="a0_res/s3c_activekit.png"/>
		</center>
	
		<p>
			We are now all set to do actual development work on our C/C++ application. Let’s start by building the CS488 program. Click on the <b>Build</b> text in the status bar or press <b>F7</b>. In the <i>Output</i> window you can follow the progress.
			After building the program, we can run or debug it. To run the program, click the little play icon in the status bar or press <b>Shift+F5</b>. To debug the program, click the little bug icon in the status bar or press <b>Ctrl+F5</b>. The program output appears in the <i>Terminal</i> window.
		</p>

			<img style="max-width : 100%" src="a0_res/s3c_statusbar_debug_run.png"/>
		</center>


	<h3>Step 4: Modify main.cpp</h3>
	<p>
	By default, the code will render white noise. Modify <code>static void draw()</code> in <code>main.cpp</code> to something new. The commented out code provides another example beside white noise. <code>FrameBuffer.pixel(i, j)</code> in this function refers to a pixel at <code>(i,j)</code> which stores <code>float3(r, g, b)</code> as the red, blue, and green components of this pixel. For example, <code>FrameBuffer.pixel(i, j) = 1.0f</code> means that the red component of this pixel is set to the maximum intensity. You can set a value more than 1.0, but that would not make it any brighter. You can also set a negative value, but it will be clamped to 0.0 when drawing. <code>globalFrameCount</code> is incremented every time this function is called.
	</p>
	

	<h3>Step 5: README</h3>
	<p>
	For programming assignments, you will be required to create a text file called <code>README</code>. Place your <code>README</code> file in your submission. The <code>README</code> file should contain two sections:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Compilation:</b> Give short instructions on how to compile and run the program, if there are any changes relative to the default build system. Mention any additional assumptions (for example, if the program must be run from a particular directory). If we find out some issues, TAs may ask you more details after the due date. </li>
		<li><p><b>Specification:</b> This part is not a restatement of the assignment specification. It should include any details or assumptions that you have made that were not included in the assignment. Tell us about any extra commands, options or features you added, or any additional files that you may have generated. If you have made any assumptions about the assignment specification or the objectives, be sure you state and justify them here.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	You should also note in your <code>README</code> whether each objective is completed or not. If you wrote code for objectives that you did not get completed, you may request <b>partial credit</b> there.
	</p>


	<h3>Step 6: Submitting your program</h3>
	<p>
	Create a ZIP file named <code>A0.zip</code> containing all of your files. Do not include the default external libraries (GLEW, GLFW, linalg.h, gif.h, stb, etc.) as the TAs will have them set up on their end. Upload it to LEARN. Avoid including unneeded build files or any other temporary files (e.g., .DS_STORE junk).
	</p>
	<p>
	We highly recommend that after submitting, you download your own <code>A0.zip</code> file, unzip it and build it to ensure that everything compiles and builds as expected. Be sure to test that your submitted <code>A0</code> executes correctly and matches your expectations.
	</p>
	<p>
	Take special care as your machine may have a newer compiler. As such, your code may not compile on our side, especially if you make use of features that might not be widely available.
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition to the code, you are generally asked to provide a saved image (aka., screenshot) of your result(s). You can save your current result by pressing the "I" key. The file name will be a random number, so rename it to <code>screenshot.png</code> and include it to your zip file. In later assignments, you may need to provide multiple images to demonstrate your results.
	</p>


	<h3>Step 7: Objectives</h3>
	<p>
	Every assignment includes a list of objectives. Your mark in the assignment will be based primarily on the achievement of these objectives, with possible deductions outside the list if necessary.
	</p>

	<div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Assignment 0 objectives</h3></div><ul class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item"> 
			&#x25a2; Registered on the Piazza page.
		</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">
			&#x25a2; The file <code>A0.zip</code> has been submitted and contains the correct files.
		</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">
			&#x25a2; Included an appropriate <code>README</code> that explains your modification.
		</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">
			&#x25a2; Included an appropriate screenshot as <code>screenshot.png</code> that shows your modification.
		</li>
		<li class="list-group-item">
			&#x25a2; The program renders something other than noise.
		</li>
	</ul></div>
